% In M-ary PSK, N bits are grouped into symbols, where M = 2^N, and phase 
% difference between symbols is 2*pi/M. In the constellation diagram, symbols 
% are placed around a phase circle, keeping a constant amplitude. Increasing N 
% reduces bandwidth but raises error probability due to reduced symbol distance d.


% QAM is a system that combines phase shift keying and amplitude shift keying, 
% also known as QASK or QAM. If the carrier's amplitude varies along with the phase, 
% points lie inside the circle as well. This improves noise immunity by allowing 
% signal vectors to differ in both phase and amplitude.
